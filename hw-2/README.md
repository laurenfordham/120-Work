# This Week's Homework Cycle
This week's homework was a little more difficult than I thought it would be. It took a lot of getting used to. Understanding the programs and what I use each for was _really hard_ at first. I followed each piece of instruction this week to a T as much as i possibly could. I tried different ways of creating files, terminal, finder, and atom. I realized I would more likely prefer to use finder just to create files, but for documents, atom is the way to go.


## Steps Taken
- Download Atom & GitHub Desktop
- Learn how to use these applications
- Create files and documents for each instruction on the lesson
- Create a repository for the class using GitHub
- Download Packages & Themes
- Learn how to commit to master
- Eventually learn markdown and how to make this document as a whole


### Issues I had
The main problem I had was learning how to use each program and finally relaizing theyre not interchangable and that I need them both. Learning how to work each application in the way I needed was something I worked at on my own. Ther were no Issues posted this week so I never got the chance to help others. I think I gained a pretty good udnerstanding of what we're doing rught now.

-Something I would like to know more about is why do we use terminal if we can just use finder?

-I am confused when to use code, I don't understand its pertinance in this document. I would like to know more about that.

  I learned the steps on how to commit a change.
  1. Change the document or file.
  2. go to GitHub Desktop where you will see "changed".
  3. Click on your changes and then add a summary.
  4. The summary should be reasoning as to why the item was changed.
  5. After a summary has been created, commit it to master.
  6. This then creates the change with a reason you can go back to.


The [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) helped me **a lot** to write this page.
