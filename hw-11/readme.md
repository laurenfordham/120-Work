# Problems I Had
  I had alot of problems with this sketch. I had a very hard time figureing out how to first move the monsters and how to keep them in bounds. I eventaully had to seek help from both Quinn & Dr. Musick.

## What I Learned
  I learned how to create a class. How to create objects inside a class and how ot portrya them. I learned how to call classes. I learned how to move objects within bounds.
