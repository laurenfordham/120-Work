# Problems
I'm starting with problems because that was my whole assignment. I had the hardest time getting started and actuallt understanding what to do! I eventually got an appointment with Quin, which helped me IMMENSLEY.
I had a hard time with more than one thing.
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - variables, what the numbers mean/how to get them. I realized I just didn't understand that theyre numbers you choose.
    - making sure I had commas, semi colons, and parentheses.
     - sandboxing and nesting

  ## What I Learned
  I learned so much this lesson. I learned how to animte objects using variables and simple math! I learned how to correctly sandbox and nest. I learned that capitals really make a diference in the way your sketch works.
