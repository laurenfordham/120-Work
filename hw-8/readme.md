# What I learned
This week's lesson was really helpful for understanding a lot of key componenets. It really helped me understadn conditional statements better. I also learned how to use for loop and while loop. These things were easy to grasp once I read into it. I really enjoyed this week actually.  also practiced my math skills by making the triangles purely based on the wdth and height.
## What I Found Difficult
  I found using semicolons instead of commas to be hard to remember. I messed up on this a couple of times which resulted in error and frustrated me. After I got the hang of it, it wasn't as big of a deal as I had thought.
