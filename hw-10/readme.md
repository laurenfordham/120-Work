# Problems

I had a problem using the array in place of variable, I understand it's helpful but I couldn't think of a way to use it other than for number values.

## I Learned
I learned a lot about the process of code, just in the way it runs through and how important the order of things are. I learned about the arrays and functions. I don't quite understand how making the functions and naming them whatever you want lets them run so idly?
