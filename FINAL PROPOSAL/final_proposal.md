## The Proposal
  A continuously moving piece of art to resemble water flowing or grass moving. Colors will change if mouse is pressed. A moving object (attempt at a butterfly) will follow the mouse. The piece will consist of many ovals shrinking and growing to create the effect of a wave or grass in wind. I will try to make the butterfly using various shapes and colors while also using the knowledge of angle movement to be able to have its wings move!

## Influential Projects, Works, & Artists
The work of Saskia Freeke has been inspiring to me. I enjoy the way she uses her colors and shapes to really define where the piece is positioned. She also creates physical art that is similar looking to her coded works. I love the idea that work can be physical or digital and still look and act similar. Im going to take the lesson with with learning about bounds and apply this to get the shapes I want inside the frame.
## Problems To Solve, Techniques to Learn
I need to learn how to change sizes in ascending order rather than random. I will need to learn how to get colors directly monochromatic to create the effect of shading. After I get that down I'll need to figure out how to get the secondary colors when the mouse is clicked to also be monochromatic.

## The Work Plan, With Deadlines
DUE TUESDAY DECEMBER 11TH 8:00
I have two weeks to complete this project. My first efforts will be research on how to do everything. I will be watching a lot of youtube videos, a lot of review of the lessons, a lot of time will be dedicated to this. I intend to watch a lot os shiftmans videos and apply them to my piece. I have other finals but this one is actually so fun. I want to spend time on it and I will do so without having to take disciplinary action on myself because of enjoyment! I will do research and play around until DEC 3. DEC 4 - 11 I will work inside the file and attempt to create the vision inside my head. I will have this piece done before DEC 11th.

## Current State of Work

Currently I am in the research stage, I am working on figuring out how to get things to work. I am messing around with random codes about ascending sized shapes in order to get the correct format I intent to have.
