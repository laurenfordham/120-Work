# Problems
I only had really one main problem with this homework assignment, and that was the my var area. I incorperated it, but not the way I wanted to. I was hoping to do it with a triangle, but when I tried the exact instructions as the circle they wouldn't work. Could have been something I was doing wrong, not sure. But other than that I felt confident at what I was doing.

## What I Learned
I learned a lot about the mathematical process of things. I enjoyed learning about Modulo, I had never heard of it! I learned how to map, which is a really helpful thing to learn. I feel like I can be more of an artist with these techniques I learned.
