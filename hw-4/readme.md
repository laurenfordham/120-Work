# What I Learned
I learned a lot this week about using P5. It was really really interesting, really cool to see that I could make these thigns with code. I learned how to draw shapes and how to make 2D images.

## Issues

This project was really hard. It was so difficult for me to figure out all the points on the convas in order for me to put each shape. I had a hard time with using the color picker for some reason, sometimes when I would use it, it wouldnt show up on my monster. I also could not understadn the triangle code for the longest, I dont know why, but I finally understood it!

### Final Thoughts
I think this project was a lot to learn, but I did enjoy it once I understood it a bit more. I am excited to continue to learn what else I can do with code!
